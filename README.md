📘 Customer Churn Prediction using ANN
🧠 Overview

This project predicts whether a bank customer will leave (churn) or stay using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
The dataset used is Churn_Modelling.csv containing demographic and financial data of customers.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn

Streamlit (for deployment)

📊 Steps in Project

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Encoding & Feature Scaling

Building an ANN model using Keras

Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

Streamlit-based Web App for Deployment
